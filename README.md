# Image_Classifier_cmd_app
The project is an Image Classifier which can be trained and used for prediction. It was part of Udacity Nanodegree program on AI Programming with Python.
The project had two parts:
1. Training a pretrained ImageNet model like VGG using transfer learning to classify 102 species of flowers.
2. Creating command line applications that can be used to train the classifier model with several execution options and use the trained model for inference providing the class and probabilities.
